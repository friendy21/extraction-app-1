### ðŸš€ Major Refactor - Complete Application Rebuild

This version represents a complete refactor of the Extraction Application to work with a new, comprehensive database schema. The application has been rebuilt from the ground up with modern architecture patterns and enhanced functionality.

### Added

#### Database Schema Enhancements

- **Comprehensive audit trails** tracking all data changes with timestamps and user attribution
- **Data verification system** with verification status tracking for all extracted data
- **Soft deletion support** maintaining data history while hiding deleted records

#### API Layer Improvements
- **Modular API client architecture** with separate clients for different data domains
- **Type-safe TypeScript interfaces** for all API interactions and data models
- **Comprehensive error handling** with structured error responses and recovery guidance
- **Data validation using Zod schemas** for all form inputs and API requests
- **Transformation utilities** for converting data between different formats
- **Pagination support** for all list endpoints with configurable page sizes
- **Advanced filtering and sorting** capabilities across all data types
- **Bulk operations support** for efficient mass data updates
- **Rate limiting and retry logic** for robust API interactions

#### Frontend Component Enhancements
- **Refactored React components** using modern hooks and patterns
- **Enhanced employee management interface** with advanced search, filtering, and bulk operations
- **Improved department management** with hierarchy visualization and drag-drop organization
- **Real-time data synchronization** with external data sources
- **Responsive design optimization** for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Advanced form validation** with real-time error feedback
- **Loading states and error boundaries** for better user experience
- **Accessibility improvements** following WCAG guidelines

#### Documentation and Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive API documentation** with detailed endpoint descriptions and examples
- **Migration guide** from version 1.x with step-by-step instructions
- **TypeScript interfaces** for all data models with inline documentation
- **Form validation schemas** with detailed error messages
- **Code examples and use cases** for common integration scenarios
- **Development setup guide** with environment configuration
- **Troubleshooting documentation** for common issues

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **API endpoint structure**: All endpoints now require organization context (`/api/organizations/{orgId}/...`)
- **Data model field names**: 
  - Employee `name` â†’ `full_name`
  - Employee `position` â†’ `job_title`
  - Department `head` â†’ `head_id`
- **ID format**: All entity IDs changed from integers to UUIDs for better scalability
- **Authentication system**: New role-based permission system replaces simple admin/user roles
- **Response format**: Standardized API response format with success/error indicators

#### Improved Features
- **Employee management**: Enhanced with comprehensive profile management and employment tracking
- **Department organization**: Now supports hierarchical structures with unlimited nesting
- **Data source connections**: Improved configuration and status monitoring
- **Search functionality**: Advanced search with multiple criteria and real-time results
- **Data export**: Enhanced export capabilities with multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and caching for faster data loading

### Removed

#### Deprecated Features
- **Legacy API endpoints**: Old v1 API endpoints are no longer supported
- **Simple role system**: Replaced with comprehensive role-based access control
- **Integer IDs**: All entities now use UUIDs for better distribution and security
- **Direct database access**: All data access now goes through the API layer

### Fixed

#### Data Integrity Issues
- **Referential integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive validation prevents invalid data entry
- **Concurrent updates**: Optimistic locking prevents data conflicts
- **Duplicate prevention**: Unique constraints prevent duplicate employee codes and emails

#### Performance Issues
- **Query optimization**: Improved database queries with proper indexing
- **Caching strategy**: Implemented caching for frequently accessed data
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large datasets
- **Memory usage**: Optimized component rendering and state management

#### Security Enhancements
- **Authentication**: Improved token-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions for all operations
- **Data encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

### Security

#### Enhanced Security Measures
- **JWT token authentication** with configurable expiration times
- **Role-based access control** with privilege inheritance
- **API key management** for server-to-server integrations
- **OAuth2 integration** for third-party applications
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- **Input sanitization** to prevent injection attacks
- **CORS configuration** for secure cross-origin requests

### Migration Notes

#### From Version 1.x
1. **Update API endpoints** to include organization context
2. **Update data models** to use new field names and UUID IDs
3. **Implement new authentication flow** with role-based permissions
4. **Update error handling** for new structured error format
5. **Test all functionality** with the new API layer

#### Data Migration
- Use the provided migration scripts to convert existing data
- Backup all data before starting the migration process
- Test the migration in a development environment first
- Plan for downtime during the migration process

### Known Issues

#### Limitations
- **Legacy data import**: Some legacy data formats may require manual conversion
- **Third-party integrations**: Some integrations may need reconfiguration
- **Custom modifications**: Custom code modifications will need to be updated

#### Workarounds
- **Migration scripts**: Provided for common data conversion scenarios
- **Compatibility layer**: Temporary compatibility endpoints for gradual migration
- **Support documentation**: Comprehensive guides for common migration issues
